I love movies and I love data. This website is about bringing two good things together and exploring fun new tools. My goal here is not to draw any sorts of absolute truths about the data since the data has many shortcomings and often I'm using techniques for the first time, but to just play with the data and discover some recommendations and stories which would otherwise be unnoticed.
